# Welcome to HYPERPOP

This is where the digital meets the neon, where the past meets the future, and where your web experience gets **supercharged** with vaporwave energy.

## What is HYPERPOP?

HYPERPOP is more than just a blog—it's a **digital experience**. Built on the cutting-edge 11ty static site generator, this platform combines:

- 🌈 **Y2K Aesthetics** - Neon colors, glitch effects, and CRT vibes
- ⚡ **Lightning Fast** - Static site performance with zero compromises
- 🎨 **Pure CSS Magic** - Holographic borders, scan lines, and chromatic aberration
- 🎮 **Interactive Elements** - Custom cursor trails, konami codes, and more

## Features You'll Love

### Visual Effects

Every element on this site has been crafted with attention to detail:

```css
.glitch {
  position: relative;
  animation: glitch-skew 1s infinite linear alternate-reverse;
}
```

The glitch effect you see on headers isn't just decoration—it's a statement. It says we're living in a digital world, and we're embracing the beautiful chaos of it all.

### Performance First

Despite all the visual flair, this site is **blazing fast**:

- Static HTML generation
- Optimized images with WebP
- Critical CSS inlined
- Lazy loading everywhere it matters

### Accessibility Matters

We respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and ensure:

- Full keyboard navigation
- Semantic HTML structure
- WCAG AA color contrast
- Screen reader friendly markup

## What's Next?

Explore the blog, try the search, and don't forget to try the **Konami Code** on the homepage (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A).

Welcome to the future. Welcome to **HYPERPOP**.
